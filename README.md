# Awesome TNNs

This repository is an accompaniment to the article: *Architectures of Topological Deep Learning: A Survey on Topological Neural Networks* (anonymous).

*Topological Neural Networks* (TNNs) are deep learning architectures that process signals defined on topological domains. The domains of topological deep learning generalize the binary relations of graphs to *hierarchical relations* and higher-order *set-based relations*. The additional flexibility and expressivity of these architectures permits the representation of complex natural systems such as proteins, neural activity, and many-body physical systems. 

To date, the TNN literature has suffered from a lack of unification in notation and language across disparate models. This presents a real obstacle for building upon contributions in the field and applying TNNs to new problems. This repository synthesizes the literature using a single unifying notation that we use to rewrite the equations of different TNN architectures, facilitating their direct comparison.

## :brain: The Models

We rewrite model architectures using our unifying framework for most of the papers referenced in our survey.

## :toolbox: The Framework

Or unifying framework consists of a four-step process, illustrated in the figure (Fig. 7 in the paper, adapted from <a href="#hajij2023tdl">[1]</a>) and described in the equations below (taken from Section 2.3.1 of the paper):

:red_square: **1. Message:** First, a message $m_{y \rightarrow x}^{\left(r^{\prime} \rightarrow r\right)}$ travels from a $r'$-cell $y$ to a $r$-cell $x$ through a neighborhood $k$ of $x$ denoted $\mathcal{N}\_k (x)$:

$$m_{y \rightarrow x}^{\left(r^{\prime} \rightarrow r\right)}=M_{\mathcal{N}\_k}\left(\mathbf{h}\_x^{t,(r)}, \mathbf{h}\_y^{t,(r^{\prime})}, \Theta^t \right)$$

via the function $M_{\mathcal{N}\_k}$ depicted in red in the figure. Here, $\textbf{h}\_x^{t,(r)}$ and $\textbf{h}\_y^{t,(r')}$ are features of dimension $d_r$ and $d_{r'}$ on cells $y$ and $x$ respectively, and $\Theta^t$ are learnable parameters. In the simplest case, this step looks like a neighborhood matrix $M$ propagating a feature $\mathbf{h}\_y^{t,(r')}$ on $r'$-cell $y$ to $r$-cell $x$ as: 

$$m_{y \rightarrow x}^{\left(r^{\prime} \rightarrow r\right)}= M_{xy}\cdot \textbf{h}\_y^{t,(r')} \cdot \Theta^t,$$

where $M_{xy}$ is the scalar entry of matrix $M$ at the row corresponding to cell $x$ and column corresponding to cell $y$ and $m_{y \rightarrow x}^{\left(r^{\prime} \rightarrow r\right)}$ and $\Theta$ is a $d_{r'} \times d_{r}$ matrix. If $y$ is not in the neighborhood structure of $x$, then $M_{xy}$ will be 0, and $x$ cannot receive any message from $y$. 


:orange_square: **2. Within-Neighborhood Aggregation:** Next, messages are aggregated across all cells $y$ belonging to the neighborhood $\mathcal{N}\_k(x)$:

$$m_x^{\left(r^{\prime} \rightarrow r\right)}=A G G_{y \in \mathcal{N}\_k(x)} m_{y \rightarrow x}^{\left(r^{\prime} \rightarrow r\right)}$$

resulting in the *within-neighborhood aggregated message* $m_x^{\left(r^{\prime} \rightarrow r\right)}$. Here, $AGG$ is an aggregation function, depicted in orange in the figure, analogous to pooling in standard convolutional networks.

:green_square: **3. Between-Neighborhood Aggregation:** 
Then, messages are aggregated across neighborhoods in a neighborhood set $\mathcal{N}$:

$$m_x^{(r)}=A G G_{\mathcal{N}\_k \in \mathcal{N}} m_x^{\left(r^{\prime} \rightarrow r\right)}$$

where AGG is a (potentially different) aggregation function depicted in green in the figure, and $m_x^{(r)}$ is the message received by cell $x$ that triggers the update of its feature.

:blue_square: **4. Update:**
Finally, the feature on cell $x$ is updated via a function $U$ depicted in blue in the figure, which may depend on the previous feature $\textbf{h}\_x^{t,(r)}$ on cell $x$:

$$ \textbf{h}\_x^{t+1,(r)}=U\left(\textbf{h}\_x^{t,(r)}, m_x^{(r)}\right)$$

The result $\textbf{h}\_x^{t+1,(r)}$ is the updated feature on cell $x$ that is input to layer $t+1$.
